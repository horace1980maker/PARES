✅ What Changed
1. AI-Powered Real Analysis
Now uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to generate contextual, location-specific territorial insights
The AI analyzes the coordinates and generates realistic assessments based on:
Geographic location in Latin America
Regional ecosystems and environmental threats
Typical livelihoods and socio-environmental conflicts
Appropriate Nature-based Solutions (NbS)
2. Geographic Context Enhancement
Integrated OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API (free, no API key needed)
Automatically detects:
Country
State/Region
Municipality
Area type
This context is fed to the AI for more accurate analysis
3. Same Format, Better Content
Maintains the exact same format you already have
Uses the same markdown structure with **bold headers**
Frontend component requires no changes
Displays beautifully in the existing 
TerritorialInsightCard
4. Graceful Fallback
If OpenAI API key is not configured → shows the original mock data with a note
If geocoding fails → still generates analysis with just coordinates
If any error occurs → shows error message in the same format
🚀 How to Use It
Since your backend is already running with OPENAI_API_KEY configured (you're using it for chat), the territorial analysis will now automatically generate real, contextual information when you click anywhere on the map!

Test it:
Click on different locations on the map
Each location will get a unique, AI-generated analysis specific to that area
The analysis will consider the actual geography, ecosystems, and challenges of that region
